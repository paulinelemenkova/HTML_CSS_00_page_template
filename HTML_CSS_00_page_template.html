        The seagrasses, a unique group of aquatic plants growing submerged in the sea water, with root-like structures (rhizoms) buried in the sediments and vertical elongate leaves. Being a flowering plant, completely adapted to marine environment, they are however, more closely related to the lily family (Liliaceae) than to  true grass, despite their name “seagrass”, caused by the ribbon-like, grassy leaves. Realization of traditional methods for mapping seagrass usually involves intensive and time-consuming in-situ observations during the fieldwork, as, for example, reported by <a href="#Iverson and Bittaker, 1986">Iverson and Bittaker (1986)</a>

        <p>Seagrasses create unique, complex, extremely diversified and productive ecological systems in the littoral coastal zones between 0-50 meters in shallow waters all over the world, and serve as a valuable environmental indicators for the marine ecosystems health. Seagrasses are closely connected and linked with complex interactions to other vegetation types, e.g. mangroves, coral reefs, etc. Being important constructing component of littoral ecosystems, seagrass contributes significantly to their structure and functioning.
        The adaptation to the salt waters is evidently influenced the global ditribution of the seagrasses, limiting it to shallow coastal areas. <br>
        A number of critical conditions determines grouth of seagrass, including general climatic characteristics of the area, i.e.temperature, day length, geological and geomorphological conditions, e.g. soft type of sediments (sand or mud), shallow depths, as well as chemical and physical parameters of the water: salinity, waves.
        The seagrass Posidonia oceanica (further P. oceanica)  is a key species to inhabit littoral of the Mediterranean Sea (Fig.1). and is widely spread along the coasts of Crete. It plays an important role in a number of geomorphological and ecological processes. Namely, it is a source of food for herbivorous fauna as well as helter zones for fish and other marine organisms; it contributes to the nutrient recycling; it provides sediments stability by reducing the degree of water movements, etc. <br>
        The purpose of this MSc research work is to apply methods of the remote sensing (RS) and GIS towards mapping and monitoring of P. oceanica meadows along the Cretan coasts, Greece.
        The current research aims to apply methods of remote sensing including satellite, aerial photos and videometric underwater imaging as well as GIS-based spatial analysis for the environmental monitoring of P. oceanica. The technical implementation is based on ENVI, Erdas Imagine, WASI and ArcGIS software using aerial and satellite images as well as results of the underwater videometric measurements.
